This is just a placeholder repository for now.
Please create issues for feature request and collaboration.

## TODO

- [ ] Ignore words ([regex pattern](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/struct.RegexSet.html))
- [ ] Filter stopwords (similar to NLTK's stopwords)
- [ ] Different output formats (plaintext, JSON)
- [ ] Performance (SIMD support, async execution)
- [ ] Usage as library
- [ ] Recursion support
- [ ] Allow skipping files
- [ ] Allow specifying ignored words in a separate file
- [ ] Generate "heat bars" for words like shell-hist does
- [ ] Split report by file/folder (sort of like `sloc` does for code)
- [ ] Choose language for stopwords
- [ ] Format output (e.g. justify counts a la `uniq -c`)
