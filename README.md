This is just a placeholder repository for now.
Please create issues for feature request and collaboration.

## TODO

* [ ] Ignore words (regex pattern)
* [ ] Filter stopwords (similar to NLTK's stopwords)
* [ ] Different output formats (plaintext, JSON)
* [ ] Performance (SIMD support, async execution)
* [ ] Usage as library
* [ ] Recursion support
* [ ] Allow skipping files
* [ ] Allow specifying ignored words in a separate file
* [ ] Generate "heat bars" for words like shell-hist does
* [ ] Ability to split report by file/folder (sort of like `sloc` does for code)
